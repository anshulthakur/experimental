The aim of these sources is to explore data analysis on own data - like expenditure trends and lifestyle records of the past few years which will be pulled from google docs in the code itself.

In cases where offline files are avaliable, the data will be read from them itself using `Openpyxl` package.

### Stock Markets

Data will be pulled in every 30 minutes for all the stocks listed in NSE and BSE initially.
